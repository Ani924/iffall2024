    The Walt Disney Company, commonly referred to as 
    simply Disney, is an American multinational mass media and 
    entertainment conglomerate headquartered at the Walt Disney 
    Studios in Burbank, California.

    After becoming a major success by the early 1940s, Disney diversified into live-action films, television, and theme parks in the 1950s.
     However, following Walt Disney's death in 1966, the company's profits, especially in the animation division, began to decline. In 1984,
      Disney's shareholders voted Michael Eisner as CEO, who led a reversal of the company's decline through a  combination of international 
      theme park expansion and the highly  successful Disney Renaissance period of animation in the 1990s. In 2005, under new CEO Bob Iger, 
      the company continued to expand into a major entertainment conglomerate with the acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm, 
      and 21st Century Fox. In 2020, Bob Chapek became the head of Disney after Iger's retirement. However, Chapek was ousted in 2022 and Iger 
      was reinstated as CEO.

       international operations. Through these divisions,  Disney owns and operates
