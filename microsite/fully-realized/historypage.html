    In 1921, American animators Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks founded Laugh-O-Gram Studio in Kansas City, Missouri.
     Iwerks and Disney went on to create short films at the studio. The final one, in 1923, was entitled Alice's Wonderland 
     and depicted child actress Virginia Davis interacting with animated characters. While Laugh-O-Gram's shorts were popular 
     in Kansas City, the studio went bankrupt in 1923 and Disney moved to Los Angeles, to join his brother Roy O. Disney, 
     who was recovering from tuberculosis. Shortly after Walt's move, New York film distributor Margaret J. Winkler purchased 
     Alice's Wonderland, which began to gain popularity. Disney signed a contract with Winkler for $1,500, to create six series of 
     Alice Comedies, with an option for two more six-episode series. Walt and Roy Disney founded Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio 
     on October 16, 1923, to produce the films. In January 1926, the Disneys moved into a new studio on Hyperion Street and the 
     studio's name was changed to Walt Disney Studio.

    After producing Alice films over the next 4 years, Winkler handed the role of 
    distributing the studio's shorts to her husband, Charles Mintz. In 1927, Mintz
    asked for a new series, and Disney created his first series of fully animated 
    shorts, starring a character named Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. The series was 
    produced by Winkler Pictures and distributed by Universal Pictures. The Walt 
    Disney Studios completed 26 Oswald shorts.

    According to Walt, he first had the idea of building an amusement park during a visit to 
    Griffith Park with his daughters. He said he watched them ride a carousel and thought there 
    "should be ... some kind of amusement enterprise built where the parents and the children 
    could have fun together".[87][88] Initially planning the construction of an eight-acre (3.2 ha) 
    Mickey Mouse Park near the Burbank studio, Walt changed the planned amusement park's name to Disneylandia, 
    then to Disneyland. A new company, WED Enterprises (now Walt Disney Imagineering), was formed in 1952 
    to design and construct the park. Drawing inspiration from amusement parks in the US and Europe, Walt 
    approached the design of Disneyland with an emphasis on thematic storytelling and cleanliness, innovative 
    approaches for amusement parks of the time. The plan to build the park in Burbank was abandoned when 
    Walt realized 8 acres would not be enough to accomplish his vision. Disney acquired 160 acres (65 ha) of orange 
    groves in Anaheim, southeast of LA in neighboring Orange County, at $6,200 per acre to build the park.[93] 
    Construction began in July 1954.
