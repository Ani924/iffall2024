    Disney has been recognized for revolutionizing the animation industry; 
    according to Den of Geek, the risk of making the first animated feature 
    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has "changed cinema".[461] The company, 
    mainly through Walt, has introduced new technologies and more-advanced 
    techniques for animating, as well as adding personalities to characters. 
    Some of Disney's technological innovations for animation include invention 
    of the multiplane camera, xerography, CAPS, deep canvas, and RenderMan.
     Many songs from the company's films have become extremely popular, and 
     several have peaked at number one on Billboard's Hot 100. Some songs from 
     the Silly Symphony series became immensely popular across the U.S.

  Disney has been ranked number 48 in the 2023 Fortune 500 list of the largest 
  United States corporations by total revenue and fourth in Fortune's 2022 "World's 
  Most Admired Companies". According to Smithsonian Magazine, there are "few 
  symbols of pure Americana more potent than the Disney theme parks", which are 
  "well-established cultural icons", with the company name and Mickey Mouse being 
  "household names". Disney is one of the biggest competitors in the theme park 
  industry with 12 parks, all of which were the top-25 most-visited parks in 2018. 
  Disney theme parks worldwide had over 157 million visitors, making it the most-visited 
  theme-park company in the world, doubling the attendance number of the second-most-visited 
  company. Of the 157 million visitors, the Magic Kingdom had 20.8 million of the guests, 
  making it the most-visited theme park in the world. When Disney first entered 
  the theme park industry, CNN stated: "It changed an already legendary company. And it 
  changed the entire theme park industry." According to The Orange County Register, 
  Walt Disney World has "changed entertainment by showing how a theme park could help 
  make a company into a lifestyle brand".
