    In 1934, Walt Disney announced a feature-length animated film, 
    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It would be the first cel animated 
    feature and the first animated feature produced in the US. Its novelty 
    made it a risky venture; Roy tried to persuade Walt not to produce it, 
    arguing it would bankrupt the studio, and while widely anticipated by 
    the public, it was referred to by some critics as "Disney's Folly".
    Walt directed the animators to take a realistic approach, creating scenes as 
    though they were live action. While making the film, the company created 
    the multiplane camera, consisting of pieces of glass upon which drawings were 
    placed at different distances to create an illusion of depth in the backgrounds.
     After United Artists attempted to attain future television rights to the Disney 
     shorts, Walt signed a distribution contract with RKO Radio Pictures on March 2, 1936.
      Walt Disney Productions exceeded its original budget of $150,000 for Snow White 
      by ten times; its production eventually cost the company $1.5 million.

    Snow White took 3 years to make, premiering on December 12, 1937. It was an 
    immediate critical and commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing film 
    up to that point, grossing $8 million (equivalent to $169,555,556 in 2023 dollars); 
    after re-releases, it grossed a total of $998,440,000 in the US adjusted for inflation.
     Using the profits from Snow White, Disney financed the construction of a new 51-acre 
     studio complex in Burbank, which the company fully moved into in 1940 and where the 
     company is still headquartered. In April 1940, Disney Productions had its 
     initial public offering, with the common stock remaining with Disney and his family. 
     Disney did not want to go public but the company needed the money.
