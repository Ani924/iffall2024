   <h2>Instructions</h2>
    Preheat the oven to 350F. Butter a 9x13-inch baking pan or spray with baking spray and line with parchment paper.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>The Crumb and Crust:</h3>
    
    <p class="instructions">
    1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, oats, sugars, salt, and baking soda.</p>
    <p class="instructions">
    2. Stir together the butter and vanilla and pour into the flour mixture. Fold the butter into the flour mixture until evenly combined, but still slightly crumbly.</p>
    <p class="instructions">
    3. Press two-thirds (3½ cups) of the mixture into an even layer in the bottom of the baking pan. Squeeze the remaining third (1½ cups) of the mixture in your palm then break into small clumps, and set aside.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>For the Filling:</h3>
    <p class="instructions">
    1. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar and cornstarch. Add the strawberries, rhubarb, and lemon juice and stir until the fruit is well coated in sugar. Spread over the crust in an even layer.
  </p>
    <p class="instructions">
    2. Sprinkle the remaining crumb mixture over the top of the fruit.
  </p>
    <p class="instructions">
    3. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes or until the crumb topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. Let cool completely in the baking on a wire rack. Using the parchment as handles, remove from the pan and cut into bars for serving.</p>
    <p class="instructionstwo">The bars can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days.

  <h2>Recipe Websites</h2>
  <p class="websites">
    <a href="https://preppykitchen.com/">Preppy Kitchen</a> This website is one I've used for recipes for a few years now, beacuse I like the cute and clean layout of the site. It's easy to print and save recipes, and I like that there's nutrition info neatly categorized on the bottom.
  </p>

  <a href="https://bromabakery.com/">Broma Bakery</a> Broma Bakery is another website I use for baking beacuse the entire layout is aesthetically pleasing from top to bottom. I think the font choices work perfectly for a chic, designer look. And the black and white color choice lets the beautiful photos stand out.
 </p>

 <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/">Sally's Baking Addiction</a> I love this website design because it's overall categorization is amazing. All of the baked goods are separated by type and some by method. This makes it easy for the viewer to find specifically what kind of recipe they are looking for.

<h2>Non-Recipe Websites</h2>
<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a> Pinterest is very user friendly and categorized well. It's simple concept makes it easy for users to find inspiration and save it without fuss.
</p>
<a href="https://www.sephora.com/">Sephora</a> The photography is vibrant and clean against the layout of the site. The filter style and categorization is different from a site like pinterest, but it's still easy to use.
</p>

<a href="https://www.coach.com/">Coach</a> The imagery and text relationships are really nice. I like the use of the serif intertwined the all caps san serif througout the products page.
