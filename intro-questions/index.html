    <h1>Intro Questions</h1>
    <p>1. My name is Anika Nobles and I'm a senior studying communication design.</p>
    <p>2. I'm a graphic designer/illustrator and I'm taking this course for my major.</p>
    <p>3. I don't have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS.</p>
    <p>4. Since I don't know much about HTML, I'm interested to learn more about its function and how it goes hand in hand with web design.</p>
    <p>5. Designing on screen seems a bit more challenging because I can see there being mistakes that are easy to miss when working on a project. Otherwise I think the same design principles apply.</p>
    <p>6. https://drinkolipop.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorWqCjul69FLnxLCgzVIVuWbstoFjZqGEOBI2XAt99N-eykItC2 I think the Olipop website exemplifies effective design because it's legible, eyecatching, and displays their products in a striking manner.</p>
    <p>7. https://hoxtonlane.com/about Hoxton Lane effectively communicates it design services through it's stylish website. Which is full of classy fonts and sleek photography.</p>
    <p>8. https://ollivere.co/ I think this website works well because the illustrations and clean design create a striking portfolio display.</p>
