<h2>Chase Atlantic</h2>
<p>Girl, tell me what you're doing on the other side?</p>
<p>And so, just tell me, what you're doing with that other guy?</p>
<br>
<p>Cause I ain't got patience to slow down the bass</p>
<p>All your girlfriends are wasted</p>
<p>They need it, they chase it</p>
<p>Face it, you want it, you crave it</p>
<p>Believe when I say that you'll know once you taste it</p>
<br>
<p>All of your friends have been here for too long</p>
<p>They must be waiting for you to move on</p>
<p>Girl, I'm not with it, I'm way too far gone</p>
<p>I'm not ready, eyes heavy now</p>
<p>Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved</p>
<p>Running in circles, now look what you've done</p>
<p>Give you my word as you take it and run</p>
<p>Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now</p>
<br>
<p>Just give some time and space to realize</p>
<p>That you, were busy lying sleeping 'round with other guys</p>
<p>And what the hell were we?</p>
<p>Tell me we weren't just friends</p>
<p>This doesn't make much sense, no</p>
<p>But I'm not hurt, I'm tense</p>
<p>'Cause I'll be fine without you babe</p>
<br>
<p>All of your friends have been here for too long</p>
<p>They must be waiting for you to move on</p>
<p>Girl, I'm not with it, I'm way too far gone</p>
<p>I'm not ready, eyes heavy now</p>
<p>Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved</p>
<p>Running in circles, now look what you've done</p>
<p>Give you my word as you take it and run</p>
<p>Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now</p>
<br>
<p>Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now</p>
<p>I'm not ready, eyes heavy now</p>
